# Traumatic Diaphragmatic Injury (TDI) Prediction

This repository contains code and experiments for predicting **Traumatic Diaphragmatic Injury (TDI)** using the NTDB dataset (2010–2014).  
The project was developed as part of my PhD research in Computer Science.

## Contents
- `TDI-Prediction.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training pipeline.  
- Uses **Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Random Forest, Logistic Regression**.  

## Features
- Data preprocessing of NTDB datasets.  
- ICD-9 code extraction for diaphragmatic injury and related complications.  
- Supervised machine learning models for prediction.  
- SHAP-based feature importance analysis.  
- Patient-level risk calculator demo.  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.  
2. Open the `.ipynb` in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.  
3. Run cells step by step (requires NTDB dataset access).  

## Notes
- Due to privacy regulations, raw NTDB data cannot be shared.  
- Only the analysis code is included here.
